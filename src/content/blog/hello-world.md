Not that I ever left. I've just been lurking in the shadows.

I wanted a place to highlight some interesting (to me, anyway) things I've been working on, but I'm too busy and apathetic to engage with social media, so here we are.

This is probably mostly tech, maybe some talk about house projects. Things I like:

- Homelabs
- Home Assistant
- Home Improvement
- AI/LLMs/Agent (ahem) "assisted" coding

That last one, I mean... I'm not actually writing a heck of a lot of code any more. It's a bit humbling to find my primary life skill become so quickly replaced by a machine, but at the same time incredibly empowering. It's enabled me to take little ideas I've had for years and turn them into reality at warp speed. Until it becomes self aware, absolutely loving it.
