	<h3><a href="https://github.com/jamietre/jm-raid-status">JM Raid Status</a></h3>
	<p>
		A SMART health monitoring solution for both hardware RAID controllers and individual drives.
		Monitor JMicron RAID arrays alongside regular SATA/SSD/NVMe drives using a Unix pipe-based architecture.
	</p>
	<p>
		The motivation here is extending storage on my Synology NAS with cheap Mediasonic hardware RAID boxes I
		already own. They work fine, but there's no robust solution for monitoring the status from Linux. HD Sentinel
		offers a (free!) linux utility which can read the individual drive SMART data, but it's closed source and
		doesn't capture information about the overall RAID status, just individual drive SMART status. This utility
		tries to do a little more and provide a robust way to keep tabs on the status of these boxes. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reads SMART data from disks behind JMicron hardware RAID controllers</li>
		<li>Can detect degraded and rebuilding state
		<li>Utility can compose this data with `smartctl` output for overall drive states on a machine
	</ul>
