		<a href="https://github.com/hrvach/deskhop">DeskHop</a> - love this thing. It's an open-source device
		that lets you seamlessly switch your keyboard and mouse between two computers. Just move your mouse
		off the edge of the screen, and it switches the input to the other computer. No drivers needed.
		It's built on two Raspberry Pi Picos connected via UART with galvanic isolation.

		For me, it replaces a KVM - I have dedicated monitors for each computer, but don't want to use a KVM to switch human input.
		And it works so much better - I've never found a usb switcher that worked perfectly before.
		You can buy one pre-made from <a href="https://www.elecrow.com/deskhop-fast-desktop-switching.html">Elecrow</a>.
